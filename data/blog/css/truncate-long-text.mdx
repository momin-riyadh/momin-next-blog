 By default, CSS allows long text to increase the element's width or wrap to the following line. However, to truncate the text and add ellipses, the following properties are required:

- Set a defined width for the element to prevent it from growing horizontally.
- Use `overflow: hidden` to clip any text that exceeds the element's dimensions.
- Apply `white-space: nowrap` to disable text wrapping and force the text to stay on a single line.
- Finally, use `text-overflow: ellipsis` to append ellipses (...) at the end of the truncated text.

### Here's a code example demonstrating the CSS text truncation technique:
```html
<p class="truncate-text">This is a long text that will be truncated after a certain width, and an ellipsis will be added at the end.</p>
```

```css
.truncate-text {
width: 200px; /* set a fixed width */
white-space: nowrap; /* prevent text from wrapping */
overflow: hidden; /* hide overflowing text */
text-overflow: ellipsis; /* add ellipsis (...) */
}
```

By combining these properties, we can effectively truncate long text spans with an ellipsis, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout within constrained spaces.
